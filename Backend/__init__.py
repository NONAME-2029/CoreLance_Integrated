"""
fyp package initializer.

This file makes the `fyp` directory a Python package so imports like
`from prompts import ...` or package-style imports work when run as
`python -m fyp.agent` or when the parent folder is on PYTHONPATH.

You can keep this file empty if you prefer; it's present to mark the
directory as a package.
